		Don't use admin username - easy target for password guessing
		When creating a new password, WordPress will recommend a strong one. Use it. Creatings new user. WP will offer a strong password. 
		Strong passwords - use a password manager - consider pass phrase insteadk of password. Don't use same password twice. 
		Don't use user #1. Create site with throw-away user as first one. Create real user at #2. Talking low-hanging fruit here. Will not stop everything but does 
		slow down casual hacker.

Understand what is meant by Core? The files that make up the base WordPress software. Updated 3 - 4 times per year
Plugins - both activated and non-activated. They are on your website. Keep them updated. Delete unnecessary plugins. Plugin not being maintained. Find another. Vulnerable files in these deactivated plugins are still acessible from the interwebs.
Remove unused themes. Recommend keeping your active theme and the current WordPress default theme - ie twentyseventeen, twentysixteen. 
User cleaning? Get rid of any users no longer active on your website. Keep number of admins at a minimum. User role minimization. 
Reliabel backups - regular. What is regular? How often does your website change? Once a day? Once a week? Hourly? Set database to backup based on change frequency and files one period less. Depends heavily on usage.
